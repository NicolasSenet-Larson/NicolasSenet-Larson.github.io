# [SP3] Bit-coin electronic currency exchange

Bit-coin is an increasingly popular peer-to-peer electronic currency,
which obviates the need for financial intermediaries such as banks.
Bit-coin's popularity and open-source nature has spawned many
alternative crypto-currencies, and as a result there is a need
for a means to exchange one crypto-currency for another.  Currently,
the only way to do this is to exchange the original crypto-currency for a
conventional currency such as US dollars, which are then used to
buy the alternative crypto-currency.   However, in
principle coins from one crypto-currency can be exchanged directly
between e-wallets at an agreed exchange-rate.  In this project
you will develop an operational electronic crypto-currency exchange
that will allow traders to post buy and sell offers for different
currency pairs at different exchange-rates.  The system will match
the best buy and sell offers, and execute the transaction at the
agreed rate.
